The project **ConnectFour** can be executed with the file "_src/GamePanel.java_" via IntelliJ (or another Java IDE if compatible) or by using the JAR file located in "_out/artifacts/ConnectFour.jar_" along with the following command: `java -jar ConnectFour.jar`.  Furthermore, this JAR can also be found under the *Releases*.

NOTE: The original repository with commit history was hosted on my partner's GitHub, which he no longer has access to.  This repository is to serve as a public version of the project, viewable by others, without the commit history.
